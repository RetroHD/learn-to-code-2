# learn.to.code

The classic "Learn To Code" reformed into a Next.js webapp. This allows for better performance, as well as general ease-of-development. Originally developed by [OhItsRetro](https://github.com/RetroHD), reworked by [KryskZ09](https://github.com/KryskZ09).

## Starting:

```json
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
```

1. Run `npm build` followed by `npm start`.
